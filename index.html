Chips comprise the processing and memory units of the modern digital computer. Chip making is extremely precise and is usually done in a “clean room,” since even microscopic contamination could render a chip defective. Nanotechnology made transistors even smaller and chips correspondingly more powerful as the technology advanced.</p></div></li><li class="item"><input type="radio" id="radio_3" name="basic_carousel" onclick="check()" data-image="./public/images/quantum_computing.jpg" value="3"/><label class="label_3" for="radio_3">Quantum Computing</label><div class="content content_3"><h1>Quantum Computing</h1><p>Quantum computing is a type of computation that harnesses the collective properties of quantum states, such as superposition, interference, and entanglement, to perform calculations. Though the devices are currently too small to outperform usual computers for practical applications, they are believed to be able to solve certain computational problems much faster than the usual computers. In October 2019, it was announced that a quantum computer solved a problem that a standard computer couldn’t in just 200 seconds.</p></div></li><li class="item"><input type="radio" id="radio_4" name="basic_carousel" onclick="check()" data-image="./public/images/cloud_computing.jpg" value="4"/><label class="label_4" for="radio_4">Cloud Computing</label><div class="content content_4"><h1>Cloud Computing</h1><p>Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.
